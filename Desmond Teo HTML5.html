	<h3>About Desmond</h3>
		<p>Desmond's training comes from both psychology as well as human capital management. Aside from work, his personal interest in Data Science and Internet of Things (IoT) often makes him think how the future of work would look like. Can AI (Artificial Intelligence) rule the world? It is up to human to learn, reflect and figure out!</p>
		
		<p>Everyone is unique and Desmond believes career means more than merely securing a job. It is a process where individuals figure out what aligns them with their passion and aspirations - and that can change over time. </p>
